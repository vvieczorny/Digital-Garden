As you can guess by the title, I am [[Dawid Wieczorek\|David]]. What is not that obvious, is the fact. that I was born in the [[Poland\|Poland]], in the year of 2005. Another fun fact is that, I like to learn things, and I can say, I'm interested in every topic, but I am especially keen on these ones:
- **Deep Focus**
	- [[Computer Science\|Computer Science]] & [[Technology\|Technology]]
	- [[Math\|Math]]
	- [[High School\|High School]]
- **Shallow Focus**
	- [[Linguistics\|Linguistics]]
	- [[Finances\|Finances]]
	- [[Psychology\|Psychology]]
	- [[Philosophy\|Philosophy]]
	- [[Biology\|Biology]] & [[Chemistry\|Chemistry]] & [[Health\|Health]]
	- [[Astronomy\|Astronomy]] & [[Physics\|Physics]]
	- [[History\|History]]

Those notes, are here, to help me think and learn in more efficient and fun way. I am using methodology called [[Evergreen Notes\|Evergreen Notes]] popularized by [[Andy Matuschak\|Andy Matuschak]] (more about this technique [here](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)). Oh, and one small thing - these notes are made in a multiple languages (english, polish and future I hope more), that is helping me learning them. **I keep english as a global language for titles, that's help me with linking them**.
