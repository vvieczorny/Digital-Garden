I prefer linking my notes[^1], by using footnotes, because this wont interrupt note in terms of their sense - if I will change title, which is common practice in my opinion in my system, this can as i said, interrupt sense of the text. Beside that I like to name every note at the end in English, so when I write in Polish, this will for sure interrupt.
